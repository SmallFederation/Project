# Project

We're making a simple game for iOS (Possibly Android). Flat shaded/lineart style. 
Easy to digest gameplay, can be enjoyed in short bursts. You would play it on the bus or in the car.
Free to play, no in-app purchase bullshit. We just want to get a polished game as a foundation before we start
making money.
